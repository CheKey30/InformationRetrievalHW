All .java files are in the src folder. 
To run it, you should put the trecweb and trectext files into the data/output folder then run the HW1Main.java

I tested it on my own computer, 
it will cost 1.14 mins to generate the text result and 0.77 mins to generate the web result.
I used jdk 1.11 to write this project.
